## II. Assignment - build a graphic for a *Social Media* post

- Goal: Create a graphic for a *Social Media* post (for example, Instagram, Facebook or LinkedIn)

### Phase 1: Choose Your Angle
- Before opening Canva, decide what you want to say. Choose one of the following themes:
  - The AI Debate: A "hot take" on AI-generated art or code.
  - Industry Insight: A "Did you know?" stat about game development or XR.
  - The Future: A bold prediction about the Metaverse or modern web dev.
  - Career Advice: A tip for landing an internship in interactive media.

### Phase 2: Technical Requirements
Once you’ve picked your subject, log into Canva and follow these constraints:
- Select a Platform: Choose a specific template size (ex. Instagram Square, LinkedIn Post, or Twitter/X Header).
- The "Three-Element" Rule: Your design must include:
  - One High-Quality Image: Use a stock photo or an AI-generated image within Canva.
  - Hierarchy of Text: A bold headline and a smaller sub-headline/call to action.
  - Brand Element: Add a logo, a decorative shape, or a border to frame the content.
- Color Theory: Modify the template’s default colors to a custom palette that matches the "mood" of your topic (e.g., neon/dark for tech, soft/neutral for career advice).

### Phase 3: Submission
- Export: Download your file as a PNG or JPG, and post to myCourses
- Reflect: In the comments field of the dropbox, write 1–2 sentences explaining why you chose your specific layout and how it helps deliver your message.
