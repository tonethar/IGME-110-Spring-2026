## III. Brainstorming Tips

- From [LinkedIn Learning: Brainstorming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-brainstorming/defining-the-purpose-of-brainstorming-14168757)
  - Rule 1: Have the right number of brainstormers (5 to 7)
  - Rule 2: Don't fill the room with the same person:
    - fill it out with people who feel differently than you
    - don't be afraid to say stupid things
  - Rule 3: No pop quizzes
    - don't spring brainstorming on people! Give them opt out option and 2 day notice
    - give people time to consciously or subconsciously solve it. Adults are serial problem solvers
    - we start solving problems subconsciously the moment we are presented with them. Give people the problem ahead of time
  - Rule 9: Leave the judge at the door
    - eliminate idea criticism from the session
  - Rule 10: Document the Brainstorming Process
    - make it everyone's responsibility - write down your idea
  - Rule 11: Every team needs a coach
    - energy declines! We all stare blankly at each other
    - alter the problem in some way
  - Rule 12: Capture Residual Ideas
    - more ideas will come later
