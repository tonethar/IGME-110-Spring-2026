# Project 2: Infographic - Mockup/Draft

- Now that you have a plan for your infographic, it's time to start creating it. You'll be creating the first draft of your infographic so that it can be critiqued in class
- Designs are never perfect the first time around - there's always something that can use improvement. So you will be graded on the completeness of your draft, but not on its quality. That doesn't mean you shouldn't take this seriously, though, because it's your one chance to get feedback before the project is due!

## I. Infographic Requirements
- Your infographic needs to include the following elements:

1) A ***title*** - one that is clearly identifiable and legible, and that makes it clear what the infographic is about.

    - So, just using the title of the product is not enough ...
    - What aspect of the product are you talking about? Features? How it compares to others? A timeline of how that type of product has evolved? The process of using it?

2) At least ***five elements*** in the infographic. Each should be labeled in a way that is clearly identifiable and legible, and that gives the reader an immediate sense of what the infographic conveys

    - Think about the Canva video on infographics, and how it started with the presenter trying to identify the topic of an infographic based on the element titles and images alone

3) And speaking of images, ***each element should have an image*** that clearly illustrates its role in the overall infographic
    - The images should be similar in their design, and easy to recognize when scanning the infographic. Photographs are generally a poor choice here - you want clear, clean graphics
    - Consider using sites like the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) or [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). Some of the tools we've suggested (like Canva and Adobe Express) also have images and icons available

4) A ***color scheme, typefaces, and images that are cohesive and appropriate***. These can come from your original mood board plan - or, if you've decided to go in a different direction, colors and images that are still part of a specific design approach/theme

## II. Documentation Requirements

- You'll be critiquing each other's designs in class, so be prepared to explain why you chose your design approach!
- Put your answers to the following 5 questions into a Word DOC file:
  - Who is the audience for this?
  - What do you want it to accomplish?
  - What type of infographic did you use, and why?
  - How do the design elements (color, images, typeface) help to focus the design on your audience and goal?
  - Why did you lay the elements out the way you did?

## III. Submission to myCourses

1) A PDF of your Infographic that meets the requirements of Section I. above

2) A Word doc with your design decisions spelled out as detailed in Section II. above

- ***This Word doc will also contain a section where you cite your sources:***
  - first, which specific tool are you using to create your infographic? Canva, Photoshop, Illustrator, ...
  - second, link to your chosen typefaces
    - if it's (for example) a font that's built-in to the text tools of Photoshop or Canva, go ahead and search for the font on https://fonts.google.com or https://fonts.adobe.com or similar, and then put the font's link into [**ZoteroBib**](https://zbib.org/) to get a formatted citation
  - third, cite each of your ***data sources*** (including the proposal you chose, the link to the PDF is fine), and ***image sources***, as you did for your Project 1 sources, see:
    - [**ZoteroBib**](https://zbib.org/) - Quick citation generator
    - [**RIT Library Citation Guide**](https://infoguides.rit.edu/citation)
  - fourth, cite images created with Gen AI:
    - see the citation guidelines here - https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai-updated-revised/
    - note: you DO NOT need to provide your prompt for any images you create for this project with Gen AI
  - fifth, any other Gen AI use MUST be documented as above, but MUST include all prompts
