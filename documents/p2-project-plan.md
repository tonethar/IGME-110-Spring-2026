You may choose ANY proposal from the collection - it doesn't have to be from your own team's work.

## Important Context
Keep in mind that infographics are primarily intended for displaying data in an easy-to-understand visual context. As a result, you'll be drawing from the research that was done on the product, and finding a way to display that in a visually compelling way. It's also quite likely that you'll need to supplement that research with some of your own.

## Required Sections

### 1. Proposal Selection
**Explain which proposal you decided to work with and why.**
- What was it about that particular proposal that made you want to select it? 
- There should be clear intent behind your reasoning, not just "because I felt like it."
- Consider what visual opportunities the proposal offers

### 2. Target Audience & Goals
**Describe who the infographic is targeted at and what you want to accomplish with it.**
- Watch the "Five Ws of Success" in the LinkedIn Learning Infographics course for details on what to include: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-infographic-design-14154168/defining-the-5-ws
- Focus especially on the "What" and "Who" sections
- Be specific about your infographic's purpose (inform, persuade, compare, explain, etc.)

### 3. Data Requirements
**Describe the data you'll need to accomplish your infographic's goal.**
- How much of that data is already available in the product proposal you're working with?
- What additional data do you think you might need to gather?
- Keep in mind that data can take a wide range of forms:
  - Statistics
  - Timelines
  - Lists or feature comparisons
  - Process flows
  - Market research
  - User demographics

### 4. Mood Board
**Create a visual mood board that establishes your design direction.**

The mood board should include examples of:
- **Typography:** Fonts that would work well for your audience and message
- **Colors:** A color palette appropriate for your topic and tone
- **Images/Graphics:** Visual styles, icons, or illustrations that inspire your approach
- **Reference Examples:** Other infographics or designs that influence your vision

## Submission Requirements
- Format: Single .docx file
- The mood board should be included/embedded in the document
- Submit to myCourses dropbox
- See myCourses for specific due date and time

## Grading Considerations
Your plan will be evaluated on:
- Thoughtful proposal selection with clear rationale
- Well-defined audience and objectives
- Comprehensive data planning
- Professional mood board that demonstrates design thinking
- Overall coherence between all sections
