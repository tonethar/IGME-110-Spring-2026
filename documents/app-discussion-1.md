# App (or Product/Service) Discussion

## I. App purpose and features
- Application Definition Statement - What’s it do? Who’s it for?
- Apps should be a focused solution to a well-defined problem. Build scalpels, not Swiss Army knives
- Features should support the application definition statement
  - *Meh* app def statement  - *Smart gloves that constrict and shock the user when they doom scroll too much*
  - *Meh* features
    - gloves heat up, constrict, and lock up  when users doom scroll too much
      - funny! But we can do better ...
  - Better! app def statement  - *AI-enabled gloves for users who want to be more productive in their lives*
  - More Better! features
    - companion app for categorizing activities (encourage/discourage)
    - thresholds for reward/correction
    - haptic feedback from gloves to signal to users when thresholds are met
    - quick removal and donning of gloves
    - Other features - snacking/junk food detection

- Remember that this is also App Proposal "Cage Match" (*you want your proposal to win, right??*)


## II. UI Considerations
- You need to provide some UI mockups in your proposal
- You will probably follow conventions
- [Apple HIG (Human Interface Guidelines)](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
  - The Patterns and Components categories are probably most useful right now
- [Google Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)
